VZ-1 / VZ-10 (and possibly VZ-8) Sound Synthesis Elements

Voices

Each voice is created using (upto) 8 modules (M1 - M8) each consisting of a DCO and DCA.
Pairs of modules form internal lines:
	M1 & M2 = Line A
	M3 & M4 = Line B
	M5 & M6 = Line C
	M7 & M8 = Line D
	
M1 	DCO1--DCA1--|
				|-- Line A
M2 	DCO2--DCA2--|
 
M3 	DCO3--DCA3--|
				|-- Line B
M4 	DCO4--DCA4--|
 
M5 	DCO5--DCA5--|
				|-- Line C
M6 	DCO6--DCA6--|
 
M7	DCO7--DCA7--|
				|-- Line D
M8	DCO8--DCA8--|
	
	
Each line may be formed by combining the pair of modules thus:
	Simple Sum: My + Mx
	Ring Modulation: My + Mx x My
	Phase Modulation: My(Mx)
	
	The second of the pair of modules always feeds the line.
	The first module may be mixed with the second module to feed the line.
	The first module may phase modulate the second module.
	The second module may ring modulate the first module. The output of the ring modulation is mixed with the second module to feed the line.
	
	The second module may be phase modulated by the output of the previous Line.
	M4(Line A)

DCO
===

Each module has a DCO.
Each DCO waveform may be selected from:	SINE / SAW1 / SAW2 / SAW3 / SAW4 / SAW5 / NOISE1 / NOISE2
	Increasing Sawtooth values have increasing quantity of harmonic content.
	Noise 2 includes some fundamental pitch
Each DCO may be detuned +/-127 notes and +/-100 cent(63 x 1.6 cent steps). Alternatively the "harmonic" value may be set. Adjusting either the harmonic or the octave / note / fine values automatically adjusts the other.
Each DCO may be set to a fixed frequency set by the Octave / note / fine settings and may be offset by the x16 switch.

DCA
===

Each module has a DCA.
Each DCA has an 8 step envelope.
	A sustain point can be attached to one envelope step.
	An end point can be attached to one envelope step. This clears remaining steps.
The depth of the envelope may be adjusted for each DCA.
There is a 6 step key follow curve to control the amplitude of each DCA.
Amplitude of each DCA may be affected by key velocity.  Sensitivity and curve of key velocity may be set.
Sensitivity to envelope bias and tremolo can be adjusted for each DCA. These bias may be from after-touch, definable wheel 1/2 or foot VR.

Global
======
DCO
There is an 8 step DCO envelope to control the pitch of all DCOs.
	A sustain point can be attached to one envelope step.
	An end point can be attached to one envelope step.
	The scale of the pitch envelope can be adjusted with Range / Depth setting.
There is a 6 step key follow curve to control the pitch of all DCOs.
The key velocity control of pitch may be controlled setting sensitivity and curve.
Vibrato can be set globally for all DCO:
	Waveform: Triangle / Sawtooth Up / Sawtooth Down / Square
	Depth
	Rate
	Delay
	Multi switch allows independent trigger of vibrato for each key
The octave can be set globally for all DCO.

DCA
Tremolo can be set globally for all DCO:
	Waveform: Triangle / Sawtooth Up / Sawtooth Down / Square
	Depth
	Rate
	Delay
	Multi switch allows independent trigger of vibrato for each key
The overall amplitude / level can be set globally for all DCA. This is independent to synth volume control.
Each voice can be named up to 12 characters.

Common
There is a 6 step key follow rate curve which affects the rate at which keyboard follow will react for both DCOs and DCAs.
There is an 8 step key velocity rate curve which affects the rate at which keyboard velocity will react for both DCOs and DCAs.
	Sensitivity
	Curve
	DCO steps to affect
	DCA steps to affect
